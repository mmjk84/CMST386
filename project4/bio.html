      <p>
        In 2009, I was introduced to photography and started to pursue the craft of ‘painting with light’ where my work was receiving recognition that spread rapidly throughout family, friends, and communities.  Since then, I had the opportunity to  photograph many weddings, commercial, editorial fashion, and being a guest speaker at many events.  I’ve been published on many blogs, magazines, and social media such as: WeddingWire Couple's Choice Award, Premier Bride Magazine, MOD Wedding Blog, and CBS News!
