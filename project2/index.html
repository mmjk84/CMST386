  <h2>Final Project Proposal <br>
    
  CMST 386 – Martin Kim</h2><p>
  
  <b>Client and Topic</b><br>
  
  The detail of this proposal is for creating my freelance business of wedding photography services.  
  Anyone can claim to be a photographer since digital photography allows flexibility for errors that can 
  be fixed to a non-trained professional.  This in turn, gives potential clients a lack of trust and the 
  feeling of security that they are in good hands.  It’s considered a large investment of their part, and 
  because photography is about being visual, good portfolio demonstration is key. The website will showcase 
  my portfolio, biography, contact information, and pricing guide.
  
  Development Process + Engagement Development
  
  I will make the website for future brides to be, as I will research other competitor’s contents for inspiration. 
  The website will make use of the strategic keywords using SEO tools. Google Analytics will demonstrate traffic, followers,
  device platforms, time length on site, geographical locations, and outreach which all good resources to take into 
  consideration of business.  Engagement aspect will be attraction through my personal photo collection and design elements
   for clients to be attracted to the photos.
  
  <p><b>Testing</b></p><br>
  
  The design testing will be conducted to test out the layout and most importantly the functionality in relation to the 
  design.  The testing will be done through two main popular browsers Google Chrome for Windows/Android and Safari for 
  iOS devices. The site will be checked to fit multiple platforms from desktop to mobile.
  
  Business and Website Description
  
  My personal business showcases the photos from my previous clients and to make sales of enlarged prints for albums, 
  canvases, and general prints.  The intended audience will range from engaged couples to wedding ready clients. The 
  website will mainly be advertised in America but open to international clients.  My clients will not be limited to 
  race, gender, religion, political views, etc. clients are clients as wedding industry is based on volume and by limiting 
  specific discrimination would limit potential clients, effect business reputation, and create disconnect with networking 
  with vendors. The main elements will consist of vibrant, clear, and high-resolution photos and using bright and airy imagery 
  with white background and elegant fonts.  I will not be using any content from other sources.  The website will be updated 
  every month from clients to clients.
  
  
  
<p><b>Growth and Maintenance</b></p><br>
  
  I think the website will continue to grow and evolve over time starting with photos first and then eventually add in 
  blogs of my client events for documentaries and social media interaction with potential clients and fans of my work.  
  The maintenance of the website could be easier to maintain by creating galleries, slideshows, photo blogs, and cycling 
  images of new images when available, preferably monthly or couple months.
  
  
  <p><b>Organization</b></p><br>
  
  
  The diagram above is a simplistic layout of the main menu items and sub menus with direct naming for easy navigation and 
  expectations of the user/clients.  The main menu will have extended drop-down menu such as the gallery showcasing four main 
  items.  The portfolio gallery will showcase my photography of weddings and engagements either in stand-alone images to cycle
   through or in slideshow format. Biography will contain a brief history of myself and awards of recognition.  Pricing will 
   show a range from economical, standard, and premium packages.  Contact menu will directly point to my email for inquiries.

  <p><b>Webhosting</b></p><br>
  
  When creating and maintaining a photography website, there are a few factors to consider in terms of having a successful 
  photography website. The hosting service must be able to provide high bandwidth for upload, download, and displaying multiple 
  images in galleries and streaming slideshows.
  
  Updates and maintenance can be streamlined and automated through the company’s end so self-maintenance will be seemingly 
  obsolete, offering SEO technology, and SSL certificates providing secured data and legitimacy of being a ‘real’ functioning 
  website along with accepting payments for e-commerce of sales. The companies that are great options for my needs would be
  either Format or Squarespace as both are reputable in terms of performance, maintenance, and high rating reviews from 
  consumers. The site will be coded with HTML5 and CSS. The domain will be www.photosbymartin.com 
  
  
  <p><b>Marketing</b></p><br>
  
  Marketing strategies will mainly be focused online emphasizing the use of social media marketing platforms that are 
  heavily based on the use of photographs such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, and Pixieset.  Such applications 
  have the option to ‘share’ on each other’s platforms making advertising easy and streamline from computers to mobile devices.
  On-site advertising would be offering sample pieces for hotels, restaurants, and companies.  Hosting public art galleries
  and exhibits.  
  
  <p><b>Security</b></p><br>
  
  Security features will be applied for gallery downloads and e-commerce by providing security pin numbers, dual factor 
  authentication, and using online payment methods such as Stripe.  Companies like Back Blaze will also provide redundancy 
  and backup of images being stored as well in case of site crash and through hosting services providing their own resources 
  of backing up as well.
