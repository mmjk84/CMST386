      Metatags and Keywords have their difference and benefits.  Keywords are not only part of the content but is also used to identify what the overall content is about.  While Metatags are created by the originator of the content describing what the content is about and its relations to the content. Keywords identify what your is about and then the search engine knows what terms or phrases are highly searched by users and looks for those words and phrases on web pages. The search engine uses this information rank websites, blogs, and any other media content as also called Search Engine Optimization. Meta tags are snippets of code communicates with search engines of important information about websites, such as how they should display it in search results.
